        <h2>5 Types of Thinking</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Procedural</strong> - what are the steps?</li>
          <li><strong>Abstract</strong> - "1+1 = 2"</li>
          <li><strong>Systematic Debugging</strong> - find the problem and fix it</li>
          <li><strong>Technological Empathy</strong> - e.g. knowing the "u" tag will make underline text</li>
          <li><strong>Systems</strong> - breaking down the code into components</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="sub-topic"><!-- start of The Basics -->
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
          <div class="det-topic"><!-- start of Web -->
            <h3>Web</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>A collection of HTML documents and other content (e.g. plain text, HTML, images, videos, music, etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="det-topic"><!-- start of HTML -->
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Hypertext Markup Language</li>
              <li>Text content - what you see</li>
              <li>Markup - what it looks like</li>
              <li>References to other documents (videos, etc.)</li>
              <li>Links to other pages - connects multiple pages together</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="det-topic"><!-- start of Major Pieces -->
            <h3>Major Pieces</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>User Computer</strong> contains a program called a <strong>Browser</strong> that is used to interpret the HTML page and display it on the user's screen.</li>
              <li>The <strong>Internet</strong> is the world's largest computer network.</li>
              <li><strong>HTTP protocol</strong> is the main protocol used on the web; this enables the user computer to send and receive HTTP Requests with a server.</li>
              <li><strong>Servers</strong> are computers that host the files that make up the Web. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer, where the web Browser interprets and dispays the page.</li>
              <li><strong>HTML Markup</strong> is made up of <strong>tags</strong>.</li>
              <li>HTML ignores white space; you have to code line breaks, etc. to display the text the way you want it.</li>
              <li>An <strong>Element</strong> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</li>
              <li>An <strong>Attribute</strong> is a property of an HTML tag (e.g. HREF is an attribute of the anchor tag).</li>
              <li>Tags can be inline or block; inline does not add any width or height; block tags surround the content in an invisible box, which adds height and width.</li>
              <li>HTML document structure contains a heading (typically the title of the page); document type; an opening and closing "html" tag which surrounds the main body of the HTML content; and the body, which contains the main content of the page.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="det-topic"><!-- start of Common Tags -->
            <h3>Common Tags</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>&#60;b&#62; - makes text bold (this should be last option to use for highlighting text</li>
              <li>&#60;strong&#62; - used to define important text for screen readers (typically makes text bold);</li>
              <li>&#60;em&#62; - makes text italic</li>
              <li>&#60;u&#62; - makes text underlined</li>
              <li>&#60;a&#62; - anchor - used for making links; contains attributes, e.g. HREF.</li>
              <li>&#60;img&#62; - image - used to include images on the page; does not have a closing tag</li>
              <li>&#60;br&#62; - inserts a line break; can have multiple; does not have a closing tag</li>
              <li>&#60;p&#62; - paragraph - block tag; browsers automatically add some space (margin) before and after each element. The margins can be modified with CSS (with the margin properties).</li>
              <li>&#60;span&#62; - used to group in-line elements in a document</li>
              <li>&#60;div&#62; - block tag; defines a section in an HTML document and/or used to group block-elements to format them with CSS; very often used together with CSS, to layout a web page;
                <ul>
                  <li>By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the element. However, this can be changed with CSS.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>&#60;h1-h6&#62; - headers (largest to smallest font size)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <h4>THE END OF STAGE 0 NOTES</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson"><!-- start of Stage 1 -->
    <h1>Stage 1</h1>

    <div class="sub-topic"><!-- start of Stages of Expertise -->
      <h3>Stages of Expertise</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ignorance - you don't know something exists; it takes about a minute to move from Ignornance to Awareness</li>
        <li>Awareness - you now know something exists; it takes days to move from Awareness to Ability</li>
        <li>Ability - you can do it, but takes some focus (not second nature); it could take years to move from Ability to Fluency</li>
        <li>Fluency - you are a master/ expert at it (no thinking needed)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-topic"><!-- start of The Tools -->
      <h3>The Tools</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Developer tools</strong> within the browser - e.g. Google Chrome allows you to view the HTML and CSS tagging</li>
        <li>Multiple <strong>text editors</strong> exist to write your HTML:
          <ul>
            <li>Scratchpad - this is the most basic of editors; good for beginners but not as powerful, helps by adding closing tags, etc.; provides immediate feedback to the user so they can see their changes; unable to share your HTML (but you can write your HTML; and CSS (inside style elements, inside of Scratchpad - then copy paste into Codepen to share); only supports HTML and CSS languages</li>
            <li>Codepen - ; provides feedback to the user in a few seconds so they can see their changes; can share your HTML but will require a Codepen account; supports HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages</li>
            <li>Sublime - most advanced editor - ; requires a page refresh so the user so they can see their changes; able to share your HTML with other users (writes the code to your computer); you can drag the little icon at the top to a browser so you can see your HTML as a web page; supports all language; you can open an HTML file in the browser, and then make updates in Sublime, hit refresh in the browser to see the changes</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-topic"><!-- start of The Language and Structure -->
      <h3>The Languages and Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML - the language of the web; has syntaxes and rules; the browser turns HTML tags into elements that form a tree</li>
        <li><strong>DOM</strong> - document object model; tells the browser how to make the elements into the tree; the browser uses the DOM tree to display the web page</li>
        <li><strong>CSS</strong> - changes how the HTML elements look on a web page; CSS styles get assigned to classes as defined by the user; then these classes can be used as parameters in an HTML element to set the style</li>
        <li>Javascript - used to code interactive items on a web page</li>
        <li>Head tag - this is where you add the link to the CSS styling (using the "link" tag and specifying the name of the file that contains our CSS style information"</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-topic"><!-- Coding, CSS Styling, and More -->
      <h3>CSS Styling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The general rules to follow are
          <ul>
            <li>Get the <strong>structure</strong> of the page correct - look for natural boxes</li>
            <li><strong>Size and position</strong> the boxes on the page</li>
            <li>Use <strong>Headings</strong> where appropriate. Look for repeated styles and semantic elements</li>
            <li>Write the <strong>HTML</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Apply styles</strong> from largest to smallest</li>
            <li>Fix things - <strong>test</strong> in multiple browsers</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Use <strong>Development tools</strong> to make and see changes to your code without having to change the CSS (initially)</li>
        <li>It's critical to avoid repetition in coding for multiple reasons: code can become difficult to read; can lead to errors and/or inconsistencies in the code due to having to repeat the same code over and over again for elements which share the same styling characteristics; could make the code perform less efficiently for larger programs; and drive extra time and effort when changing and maintaining the code.
        <li>CSS styling enables us to avoid unnecessary repetition on the code</li>
        <li>CSS rules <strong>cascade</strong> - the last or most specific rule takes precedence</li>
        <li>CSS rules contain a Separator and a Declaration; you can use the same rule for multiple selectors by separating the selectors with commas</li>
        <li>Declarations have two parts - property and value, and are separated by a semi-colon</li>
        <li>CSS Selectors can be a Class name or a Tag name</li>
        <li>CSS styling can be added in 3 different ways
          <ul>
            <li>Write the CSS in the &#60;head&#62; of the HTML using &#60;style&#62; syntax</li>
            <li>Link the HTML to the separate CSS file; this is recommended and enables better organization for larger projects; the file is linked in the &#60;head&#62; of the HTML using &#60; link rel and href&#62;</li>
            <li>Write the CSS inline with HTML - this is not recommended as it causes repetition of code</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Browsers use default stylesheets to determine how to display HTML elements. Because rules differ sometimes, there are efforts to promote consistency in styles across browsers. One solution is using what is referred to as a CSS reset such as normalize.css</li>
          <li><strong>Box model</strong> - includes margin, border, padding, and content
            <ul>
              <li>Content - image or text appearing on the page (the nucleus)</li>
              <li>Padding - clears an area around the content and the border of the box</li>
              <li>Border - surrounds the box; is inherited from the color property</li>
              <li>Margin - hidden space between the boxes (transparent)</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Code should be structured and <strong>&#60;div&#62;</strong> is used to group/contain boxes. Use indentation in the code to help visually see the structure for easier reviewing</li>
          <li>Boxes can have their size set by % or pixels; % allows the box to be resized based on the user screen</li>
          <li>Postiioning of boxes can be done using the flex box layout within a division</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

  <div class="lesson"><!-- Questions for Instructors -->
    <h2>Open Questions</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Need more understanding on how to size the boxes and handle when there is overlap, e.g. the image overlaps with the description text</li>
        <li>Need to understand more about how to use the ID attribute, and when it is more appropriate to use ID versus CLASS</li>
